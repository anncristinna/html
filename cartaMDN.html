    <h1>RE: Eileen Dover University application</h1>
    <p>
        Dear Eileen, <br>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your 
        <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </p>

    <h2>Starting Dates</h2>
    <p>
        We are happy to accommodate you start your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start 
        at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: <time datetime="9-9-2016">9 September 2016</time></li>
            <li>Second semester: <time datetime="1-15-2017">15 January 2017</time></li>
            <li>Third semester: <time datetime="5-2-2017">5 may 2017</time></li>
        </ul> 
        Please let me now if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer. <br>
        You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on our website.
    </p>

    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub> )</li>
            <li><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>So please can you provide more informations on each off these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and others resources, and anything else
        you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>
    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-decore work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:
        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
            <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful"</dd>
            <dt>Artic robot dance</dt>
            <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explores in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stiled movements, being praticed by inhabitants
                of Northern Alaska and Canada.
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </p>
    <p>For more of my research, see my <a href="#">exotic dance research page.</a>
    <br>
    Yours sincerely, <br>
